# HexGate
HexGate is a lightweight, high-performance API Gateway built from scratch in Go.

## âœ¨Features
- **Dynamic Service Discovery**: Integrates directly with HashiCorp Consul. 
Backends are no longer static; `hexgate` automatically discovers, adds, and removes them in real-time as they register
or fail health checks.
- **Path-Based Routing**: Intelligently routes requests to different backend service pools based on the URL path
(e.g., /users/* -> user-service, /products/* -> product-service).
- **Zero-Downtime Hot Reloading**: Automatically detects changes to config.yaml (e.g., new services, auth keys)
- **JWT Authentication (RS256)**: Secures routes with a secure, asymmetric (RS256) JWT validation middleware.
- **Distributed Quotas**: Uses Redis with a `Sliding Window` algorithm to enforce shared quotas (e.g., 1000 requests/day) across all gateway instances.
- **Built-in Observability**: Exposes a `/metrics` endpoint for Prometheus, tracking request rates, latencies, and response codes
- **TLS/SSL Termination**: Secures the gateway with HTTPS, encrypting all client traffic.
## Design
![](img/architecture.png)
## ðŸš€ Getting Started
1. Prerequisites 
- Go 1.19 or later
- Docker & Docker Compose (for monitoring stack)

2. Generate SSL Certificates (for TLS)
The gateway is configured to run in HTTPS mode by default.
You must generate a self-signed certificate and private key for it to find.
```bash
cd config
# Run the openssl command
# You can press Enter to accept the defaults for all questions.
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
# Navigate back to the root directory
cd ..
```
This will create key.pem and cert.pem inside the config folder.
- cert.pem (Public Certificate): This file is sent to every client (like a browser) to prove the server's identity
and allow the client to encrypt data. It's safe to share.
- key.pem (Private Key): This is your server's secret.
It must never be shared. It's the only thing that can decrypt data sent by clients.

3. Run the full stack
```bash
docker-compose up -d --build
```

The service is now running:
- HexGate (HTTPS): https://localhost:8443
- HexGate (HTTP Redirect): http://localhost:8000
- Consul UI: http://localhost:8500
- Redis (internal): redis:6379
- Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
- Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (login: admin / admin)

4. Run the Test Backends
Open 3 new terminals and run the following commands, one in each:
```bash
# Terminal 1: A user service
go run test/backend.go -port 8081 -service "user-service" -advertise-addr "host.docker.internal"

# Terminal 2: Another user service
go run test/backend.go -port 8082 -service "user-service" -advertise-addr "host.docker.internal"

# Terminal 3: A product service
go run test/backend.go -port 8083 -service "product-service" -advertise-addr "host.docker.internal"
```

Go to your Consul UI (http://localhost:8500) and you will see these services marked as "healthy."
Your hexgate logs (via docker-compose logs -f hexgate) will show them being discovered.

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring Dashboard
HexGate is pre-configured to work with the included Prometheus and Grafana stack.

### Grafana Setup
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000 (login: admin / admin).
2. On the left menu, go to Connections (plug icon) -> Add new connection.
3. Select Prometheus.
4. For "Prometheus server URL", enter: http://prometheus:9090
5. Click "Save & Test". You should see a green success message.
6. On the left menu, click the Dashboard icon (four squares) -> New -> New Dashboard to start building.

## ðŸ§ª Testing the Gateway
### Test 1: Service Discovery & Routing
Now that your backends are running, send requests to the gateway:
```bash
# This will be routed to the "user-service" pool
curl https://localhost:8443/users/1
# Hello from user-service (Port 8081)

# Send again to see the load balancing
curl https://localhost:8443/users/2
# Hello from user-service (Port 8082)

# This will be routed to the "product-service" pool
curl https://localhost:8443/products/abc
# Hello from product-service (Port 8083)
```
Now, go to Terminal 3 (port 8081) and stop the server (Ctrl+C).
Wait a few seconds for Consul to detect the failure.

Now, all traffic for /users/ will go only to the remaining healthy backend:
```bash
curl https://localhost:8443/users/3
# Hello from user-service (Port 8082)
```

### Test 2: Authentication (JWT)
- Enable `authentication` in config/config.yaml file. All routes are now protected. A normal request will fail:
```bash
curl https://localhost:8443/users/1
# 401 Unauthorized: Missing Authorization header
```

Need to attach a JWT token to the header request
```
TOKEN=eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJleHAiOjE3NjE0NzY2NjksImlhdCI6MTc2MTM5MDI2OSwibmFtZSI6IlRlc3QgVXNlciIsInN1YiI6InVzZXItMTIzLWFiYyJ9.noYkvn-b005BoXJJEcm5YeDpkRBiNpkQ4MDN0c07nQwfhEtKb33ifToXz5LqsmcwHolnAmKX2mxfzfQm0v7BQki6fFex985WpvOGGobSxUAXMNEltT60Ees3TNDiViqTSw-q0T_CS6w5Rh5mrf53sExRlzkNLg30A0bNNuW_F91ICnxhi741U5B41JgBcAK3JVasJK6h-nTto_dWKftLNTR_sg9cSz7dDNlwoiB_8BpDP07l5L1Jf2Q5FrmFIBuQSELMz0ec2ON9s2YoL1L_vHS3_w5owSvVGQu1K1Yr3ZK6keOvdDbPY4yOQEOl0cTYZ9-HII_0-TbCBtXuZ8bEsw

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://localhost:8443/users/3
```

### Test 3: Rate Limiting
Our config is set to 1 request/sec with a burst of 3. Send 4 rapid requests:

```bash
# (Assumes you are sending the valid JWT token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://localhost:8443/users/1 # OK
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://localhost:8443/users/2 # OK
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://localhost:8443/users/3 # OK
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://localhost:8443/users/4
# 429 Too Many Requests
```
